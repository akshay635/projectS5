# Terrorism Analysis With Insights

- This project is grounded in the principles of data analysis and data visualization.

- The dataset consists of 190,000 records documenting terrorist attacks across the globe.

- Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), we discovered that nearly 75% of these incidents occurred in Asian regions, including Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Western Asia (Middle East).

- A Scatter Geomap was created using Plotly, visualizing terrorist attacks by region, country, state, and city through interactive scatter points.

- A User Interface (UI) was developed to allow users to input parameters such as region, country, state, city, date, month, and year. Based on these inputs, the system dynamically displays the scale and type of terrorist attacks using both a global map tool and a global chart tool.
